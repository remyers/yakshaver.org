### Low Bandwidth Wallet

Tasks:

 - [ ] test `electrs`, branch: `cbor_replace_compiles` branch using `client2.py` test client
 - [ ] update `electrs` to use proposed compressed-block-header scheme
 - [ ] add support for compressed block headers to BDK electrs block source
 - [ ] test BDK cli client using electrs with compressed block headers
 
Notes:

Compressed Block Headers
* [how to test compressed block headers in electrs](https://gist.github.com/willcl-ark/89bd4731c6d074f5e98ac3332286926a)
  * first step is to get bitcoind and electrs running on Signet (or testnet, but Signet much smaller)
  * replace `json.dumps` with `cbor.dumps` in `client2.py`
* should use [electrs, branch: cbor_replace_compiles](https://github.com/remyers/electrs/tree/cbor_replace_compiles) electrs fork
* CBH [Proposal](https://github.com/willcl-ark/compressed-block-headers)
* [Mailing list discussion](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2020-May/017881.html)

Bitcoin Dev Kit (BDK)
 * [Electrs connection over SOCKS5 proxy](https://github.com/remyers/BDWallet/commits/mesh)

### Lightning over Email
- [ ] c-lightning plugin based socks proxy to intercept and send channel traffic as email
- [ ] c-lightning plugin based socks proxy to ingest and process channel traffic from email
