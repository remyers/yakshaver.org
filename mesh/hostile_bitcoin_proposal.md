## Proposal

We will create a research report focused on technologies that facilitate the use of bitcoin in hostile environments. Our focus will be on the challenges faced by bitcoin users residing outside of countries with wealthy developed economies and stable liberal governments. Specifically, users with unreliable and/or expensive telecommunication and power infrastructure living in jurisdictions where bitcoin has poor legal protection and/or is subject to arbitrary enforcement by potentially corrupt authorities. We will examine the trade-offs between custodial and non-custodial solutions in this context as well as the challenges faced by populations with much fewer economic resources than bitcoin users in developed countries.

Our report will survey existing bitcoin technologies in the context of different hostile environments; particularly with respect to how they can be used in economically impoverished communities to overcome poor infrastructure problems, internet censorship, and local political risks. Our survey will include existing and future bitcoin and lightning mobile wallets, lightning communication technologies (such as Sphinx chat), geostationary and low-earth orbit satellites, amateur radio and/or commercial mesh communication systems and familiar messaging technologies like Telegram and Whatsapp.

We will conduct online interviews with our target bitcoin users in order to identify issues with existing solutions in their context. These issues can stem from a lack of monetary or technological resources. The goal of this project will be to provide specific recommendations to bitcoin developers working on building tools for people/communities living in hostile environments.

This project will be developed as an open-source online report that can be discussed and added to by the community both before and after its initial release.
